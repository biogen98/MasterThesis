\section{Operating principles}

Once rotaxane-ds is formed, the addition of ssDNA 4 (0.5μM) to the trans chamber, which
is fully complementary to ssDNA 2, induces the displacement of the latter in trans via a
strand displacement reaction, using the ssDNA 2 overhang as a toehold (Figure 2)

During the strand displacement reaction, two possible transient states possibly occur.


the cis neutravidin is transiently pushed toward
the trans side, most likely entering the lumen of the nanopore (see Section S3).

The intermediate state of the strand displacement reaction can occur in two possible
ways. In the first scenario, the DNA cargo is hybridized with the fuel exclusively
outside the nanopore in the trans solution. This implies that neutravidin will enter
inside the lumen of the nanopore. Indeed, previous studies have shown that avidin can
enter the cis lumen of ClyA but cannot translocate through the nanopore. Alternatively,
the strand displacement reaction can  take place inside the nanopore. In this case, the
DNA transport would occur from trans-to-cis rather than from cis-to-trans, as described
in the main text. We think this is unlikely, because this scenario would require the
translocation through the trans entry of three DNA strands


After the removal of ssDNA 2,
a new configuration is obtained, in which ssDNA1 and ssDNA3 remain trapped within the
pore. This configuration consists ofa 90-base-ssDNA thread on the cis end, a
10-basepair-dsDNA stretch on the trans side, and neutravidin on both sides ofthe pore
(Figure 2). We refer to this configuration as rotaxane-ss.

The subsequent addition of 0.5 μM ofssDNA 2 cargo to the cis side restores rotaxane-ds,
as ssDNA 2 hybridizes with the thread of rotaxane-ss

After each cycle, one cargo molecule is transported from cis to trans and one fuel
molecule is expended.

These cycles were found to be both at positive, + 20 mV (Figure 2a, top trace), + 50 mV
and +100 mV (Figure S3), and negative, − 20 mV (Figure 2a,
bottom trace), biases. Higher negative applied potentials (e.g., −50 mV, Figure S3)
prevented the cycling

The working of the nanopiston against and with external bias is important, postulated
that it is due to the entropic interaction between the rotaxane and the pore.
Discuss the importance of entropy. power stroke is toehold disp reaction. Results in lwo
entropy state. This entropic energy provides the recovery stroke. Next hybridisation with
the fuel strand makes us come back to the intial configuration.

Furthermore, the cycles were faster at positive than at negative applied potentials, but
were slower as the potential was increased. This voltage dependency can be explained by
toehold sequestering inside the nanopore

Due to brownian motion both autonomous and non-autonomous systems use ratcheting to
eventually deliver work. Using this method minimal synthetic machines can deliver
elegance and performance shedding the 'baggage' of biological evolution.

Figure 2.2a shows the measured current over through the nanopore during the operation
cycle. The ionic current of rotaxane-ss is lower than the blocked current ofrotaxane-ds
most likely reflecting the coiled structure of ssDNA inside the nanopore. Shows the
limitation of the experimental analysis of the pore, only view into the system is
throught the measured current. To get a more indepth understanding of the conformal
fluctuations of the pore computation analysis was performed in the form of molecular
dynamics simulations.

% action of the applied bias (from cis to trans for
% ∆?? > 0 ). Electroosmosis generates an opposing force, arising from the motion of cations
% accumulated on the walls of the negatively charged ClyA pore and the DNA thread. Finally,
% the entropic force is solely geometry specific, and pushes the rotaxane towards
% conformations with high configurational entropy. Entropic forces are expected to play an
% important role in the rotaxanes studied here, which are composed of stiff dsDNA and
