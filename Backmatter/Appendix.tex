\chapter{One Dimensional Confined Diffusion}

This appendix provides a detailed description of the motion of a Brownian particle
confined to a one dimensional domain. Due to the stochastic nature of this motion, we
will discuss the evolution of the probability density function $\phi(x,t)$, which
represents the probability of finding the particle on the position $x$ at time t.
Once the evolution of this probability function is known, the statistical properties can
be evaluated. Here, we will discuss the Mean Square Displacement (MSD), as it is used to
analyse the motion of the $0nt$ mixed rotaxane.\\
A central result in statistical mechanics is that the evolution of
$\phi$ is  described by the diffusion equation, given by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} =  D \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2}, \quad
  \label{eq:diff}
\end{equation}
where D is the diffusion coefficient of our particle.
The confinement is imposed through reflecting boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$,
which is equivalent to imposing a
vanishing particle current at the boundaries of our domain, $j = - D \frac{\partial
\psi}{\partial x} = 0$. Solving equation \ref{eq:diff} can be done using the
method of
separation of variables, where we assume that the solution can be expressed as $
\psi(x,t) = f(x)g(t)$. Upon this substitution Eq. \ref{eq:diff} becomes,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\dot{g}}{g} = \frac{\ddot{f}}{f} = - \alpha,
\end{equation}
where the two expressions are implied to be constant since the variables are independent.
The partial differential equation is now treated as two seperate ordinary differential
equations, for which we find,

\begin{align}
t:\quad \dot{g} = - \alpha g(t) \Rightarrow g(t) = e^{-\alpha t},
\end{align}

\begin{align}
  x:\quad D \ddot{f} = - \alpha f(x) \Rightarrow f(x) &= A \sin(K x) + B \cos(Kx)\\
  &= B \cos(\frac{\pi n x}{L}).
\end{align}
In the latter expression the boundary conditions impose that $A=0$ and constrain the
parameters by the relation,
\begin{align}
  \frac{\alpha}{D} = \frac{\pi^2 n^2}{L^2}.
\end{align}
By substituting the found results into the assumed form of the solution, we find the
general solution to the confined diffusion equation as the linear combination,
\begin{align}
  \psi(x,t) &= \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} C_n \cos\Big(\frac{\pi n x}{L}\Big) e^{- \frac{D\pi^2
  n^2}{L^2}t}.
\end{align}
At time $t=0$ the particle is assumed to be found at $x_0$ resulting in the initial
condition,
\begin{align}
  \psi(x, 0) = \delta(x-x_0) = \sum_{n=0}^{+ \infty} C_n \cos(\frac{\pi n x}{L}).
\end{align}
Imposing this initial condition on the found general solution of the confined diffusion
equation gives,
\begin{align}
  \psi(x, t)=\frac{1}{L} \Bigg[ 1 + \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} \cos\Big(\frac{\pi n
  x_0}{L}\Big) \cos\Big(\frac{\pi n x}{L}\Big) e^{- \frac{D\pi^2  n^2}{L^2}t}\Bigg].
\end{align}
This expression describes the behaviour of a Brownian particle in a one dimensional
confined domain. Using the found expression the MSD is calculated to be,
\begin{align}
  \langle \Delta x^2 \rangle &= \langle(x-x_0)^2\rangle\\&= \frac{L^2}{6}\Bigg[1 -
  \frac{96}{\pi^4}
  \sum_{k=0}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{(2k+1)^4} e^{- \frac{D(2k+1)^2 \pi^2}{L^2}t}\Bigg].
\end{align}
As expected, the mean square distances saturates to $\langle \Delta x^2 \rangle = L^2/6$
in the long-time limit $t \gg L^2 / D.$ To explore the other limiting case $t \ll L^2/D
$, we perform a Taylor expansion of the exponential and find,
\begin{align}
  \langle \Delta x^2 \rangle &= \frac{L^2}{6} - \frac{16 L^2}{\pi^4} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}
  \frac{1}{(2k+1)^4} + \frac{16 D t}{\pi^2} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2k+1)^2} +
  \mathcal{O}\bigg(\frac{D^2 t^2}{L^4}\bigg).
\end{align}
Using the two convergent series,
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2k+1)^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{8} \qquad \text{and} \qquad
  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(2k+1)^4} = \frac{\pi^4}{96}
\end{equation}
the free diffusion is recovered at short time scales, \cite{BICKEL200724}
\begin{equation}
\langle \Delta x^2 \rangle = 2Dt \qquad for\,\, t \ll L^2/D.
\end{equation}
