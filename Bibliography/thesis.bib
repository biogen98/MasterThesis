abstract={During the last decade coarse-grained nucleotide models have emerged that allow us to study DNA and RNA on unprecedented time and length scales. Among them is oxDNA, a coarse-grained, sequence-specific model that captures the hybridisation transition of DNA and many structural properties of single- and double-stranded DNA. oxDNA was previously only available as standalone software, but has now been implemented into the popular LAMMPS molecular dynamics code. This article describes the new implementation and analyses its parallel performance. Practical applications are presented that focus on single-stranded DNA, an area of research which has been so far under-investigated. The LAMMPS implementation of oxDNA lowers the entry barrier for using the oxDNA model significantly, facilitates future code development and interfacing with existing LAMMPS functionality as well as other coarse-grained and atomistic DNA models.},

abstract={The transport of nucleic acids through membrane pores is a fundamental biological process that occurs in all living organisms. It occurs, for example, during the import of viral DNA into the host cell or during the nuclear pore complex-mediated transport of mRNA in and out the cell nucleus and has implications in nucleic acid drug delivery and gene therapy. Here we describe an engineered DNA transporter that is able to recognize and chaperone a specific DNA molecule across a biological membrane under a fixed transmembrane potential. The transported DNA strand is then released by a simple mechanism based on DNA strand displacement. This nanopore machine might be used to separate or concentrate nucleic acids or to transport genetic information across biological membranes.},

abstract={The size of the sensing region in solid-state nanopores is determined by the size of the pore and the thickness of the pore membrane, so ultrathin membranes such as graphene and single-layer molybdenum disulphide could potentially offer the necessary spatial resolution for nanopore DNA sequencing. However, the fast translocation speeds (3,000-50,000 nt ms(-1)) of DNA molecules moving across such membranes limit their usability. Here, we show that a viscosity gradient system based on room-temperature ionic liquids can be used to control the dynamics of DNA translocation through MoS2 nanopores. The approach can be used to statistically detect all four types of nucleotide, which are identified according to current signatures recorded during their transient residence in the narrow orifice of the atomically thin MoS2 nanopore. Our technique, which exploits the high viscosity of room-temperature ionic liquids, provides optimal single nucleotide translocation speeds for DNA sequencing, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10.},

These families can be grouped into two larger classes, $\alpha$-PFTs and $\beta$-PFTs (or PFPs), based on the secondary structures of their transmembrane pore domainsOwing to substantial recent advances in the structural biology of PFTs, we are beginning to understand the pore architecture and the mechanism of pore formation for all six familiesThe specificity of PFTs and PFPs is determined by their interactions with lipids, sugars and/or protein receptors present in, or on, the target cell membraneStructural modularity enables toxins with the same pore-forming mechanism to target different host cell types by binding to different receptorsFor PFTs that contribute to infection, examining their structures, dynamics and interactions with host cells at molecular resolution provides cues for the development of therapeutics that could be highly effective in fighting disease},

abstract={Alpha-toxin, the major cytotoxic agent elaborated by Staphylococcus aureus, was the first bacterial exotoxin to be identified as a pore former. The protein is secreted as a single-chain, water-soluble molecule of Mr 33,000. At low concentrations (less than 100 nM), the toxin binds to as yet unidentified, high-affinity acceptor sites that have been detected on a variety of cells including rabbit erythrocytes, human platelets, monocytes and endothelial cells. At high concentrations, the toxin additionally binds via nonspecific absorption to lipid bilayers; it can thus damage both cells lacking significant numbers of the acceptor and protein-free artificial lipid bilayers. Membrane damage occurs in both cases after membrane-bound toxin molecules collide via lateral diffusion to form ring-structured hexamers. The latter insert spontaneously into the lipid bilayer to form discrete transmembrane pores of effective diameter 1 to 2 nm. A hypothetical model is advanced in which the pore is lined by amphiphilic beta-sheets, one surface of which interacts with lipids whereas the other repels apolar membrane constitutents to force open an aqueous passage. The detrimental effects of alpha-toxin are due not only to the death of susceptible targets, but also to the presence of secondary cellular reactions that can be triggered via Ca2+ influx through the pores. Well-studied phenomena include the stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, triggering of granule exocytosis, and contractile dysfunction. Such processes cause profound long-range disturbances such as development of pulmonary edema and promotion of blood coagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract={The interaction ofStaphylococcus aureus $\alpha$-toxin with planar lipid membranes results in the formation of ionic channels whose conductance can be directly measured in voltage-clamp experiments. Single-channel conductance depends linearly on the solution conductivity suggesting that the pores are filled with aqueous solution; a rough diameter of 11.4{\textpm}0.4 {\AA} can be estimated for the pore. The conductance depends asymmetrically on voltage and it is slightly anion selective at pH 7.0, which implies that the channels are asymmetrically oriented into the bilayer and that ion motion is restricted at least in a region of the pore. The pores are usually open in a KCl solution but undergo a dose- and voltage-dependent inactivation in the presence of diand trivalent cations, which is mediated by open-closed fluctuations at the single-channel level. Hill plots indicate that each channel can bind two to three inactivating cations. The inhibiting efficiency follows the sequence Zn2+>Tb3+>Ca2+>Mg2+>Ba2+. suggesting that carboxyl groups of the protein may be involved in the binding step. A voltage-gated inactivation mechanism is proposed which involves the binding of two polyvalent cations to the channel, one in the open and one in the closed configuration, and which can explain voltage, dose and time dependence of the inactivation.},

To explore the pore-forming mechanism of α-HL in detail, we determined the crystal structure of the α-HL monomer and prepore using H35A mutant and W179A/R200A mutant, respectively. Although the overall structure of the monomer was similar to that of other staphylococcal PFTs, a marked difference was observed in the N-terminal amino latch, which bent toward the prestem. Moreover, the prestem was fastened by the cap domain with a key hydrogen bond between Asp45 and Tyr118. Prepore structure showed that the transmembrane region is roughly formed with flexibility, although the upper half of the β-barrel is formed appropriately. Structure comparison among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions, in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond between Asp45–Tyr118. This action initiated the protrusion of the prestem. Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased in the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch on the pore formation. Based on these observations, we proposed a dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation for α-HL.}

As a major branch of PFPs, bacteria pore-forming toxins (PFTs) permeabilize membranes and usually cause the death of target cells. E. coli hemolysin ClyA is the first member with the pore complex structure solved among α-PFTs, employing α-helices as transmembrane elements. ClyA is proposed to form pores composed of various numbers of protomers. With high-resolution cryo-EM structures, we observe that ClyA pore complexes can exist as newly confirmed oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively. The 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. We also show a stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes. Unexpectedly, even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, we are the first to show that ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the dynamic process of pore assembly for the prototypical α-PFT ClyA.},
