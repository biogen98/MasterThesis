\section{Forward Flux sampling}


Simulating out of equilibrium systems, ubiquatous in the field of soft matter physics.
Lack of detailed balance, key aspect of Monte carlo methods make FFS, MD simulations the
only choice to simulate rare events. -> no guaranteed Boltzmann-like stationary
distribution.  (MD or stochastic
dynamcis)


Transition rates between two local minima in energy landscape.
Local minima, order paramters, measure flux over first order param. Factorise
probabilties. Choose a FFS variant explain the process.
