abstract={During the last decade coarse-grained nucleotide models have emerged that allow us to study DNA and RNA on unprecedented time and length scales. Among them is oxDNA, a coarse-grained, sequence-specific model that captures the hybridisation transition of DNA and many structural properties of single- and double-stranded DNA. oxDNA was previously only available as standalone software, but has now been implemented into the popular LAMMPS molecular dynamics code. This article describes the new implementation and analyses its parallel performance. Practical applications are presented that focus on single-stranded DNA, an area of research which has been so far under-investigated. The LAMMPS implementation of oxDNA lowers the entry barrier for using the oxDNA model significantly, facilitates future code development and interfacing with existing LAMMPS functionality as well as other coarse-grained and atomistic DNA models.},

abstract={The transport of nucleic acids through membrane pores is a fundamental biological process that occurs in all living organisms. It occurs, for example, during the import of viral DNA into the host cell or during the nuclear pore complex-mediated transport of mRNA in and out the cell nucleus and has implications in nucleic acid drug delivery and gene therapy. Here we describe an engineered DNA transporter that is able to recognize and chaperone a specific DNA molecule across a biological membrane under a fixed transmembrane potential. The transported DNA strand is then released by a simple mechanism based on DNA strand displacement. This nanopore machine might be used to separate or concentrate nucleic acids or to transport genetic information across biological membranes.},

Many of these molecular machines function within lipid membranes, allowing them to exploit potential gradients between spatially close, but chemically distinct environments to fuel their work cycle. Indeed, the realisation of such principles in synthetic transmembrane systems remains a tantalising goal. This tutorial review opens by highlighting seminal examples of synthetic molecular machines. We illustrate the importance of surfaces for facilitating the extraction of work from molecular switches and motors. We chart the development of man-made transmembrane systems; from passive to machine-like stimuli-responsive channels, to fully autonomous transmembrane molecular machines. Finally, we highlight higher-order compartmentalised systems that exhibit emergent properties. We suggest that such higher-order architectures could serve as platforms for sophisticated devices that co-ordinate the activity of numerous transmembrane molecular machines.}

abstract={The size of the sensing region in solid-state nanopores is determined by the size of the pore and the thickness of the pore membrane, so ultrathin membranes such as graphene and single-layer molybdenum disulphide could potentially offer the necessary spatial resolution for nanopore DNA sequencing. However, the fast translocation speeds (3,000-50,000 nt ms(-1)) of DNA molecules moving across such membranes limit their usability. Here, we show that a viscosity gradient system based on room-temperature ionic liquids can be used to control the dynamics of DNA translocation through MoS2 nanopores. The approach can be used to statistically detect all four types of nucleotide, which are identified according to current signatures recorded during their transient residence in the narrow orifice of the atomically thin MoS2 nanopore. Our technique, which exploits the high viscosity of room-temperature ionic liquids, provides optimal single nucleotide translocation speeds for DNA sequencing, while maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 10.},

These families can be grouped into two larger classes, $\alpha$-PFTs and $\beta$-PFTs (or PFPs), based on the secondary structures of their transmembrane pore domainsOwing to substantial recent advances in the structural biology of PFTs, we are beginning to understand the pore architecture and the mechanism of pore formation for all six familiesThe specificity of PFTs and PFPs is determined by their interactions with lipids, sugars and/or protein receptors present in, or on, the target cell membraneStructural modularity enables toxins with the same pore-forming mechanism to target different host cell types by binding to different receptorsFor PFTs that contribute to infection, examining their structures, dynamics and interactions with host cells at molecular resolution provides cues for the development of therapeutics that could be highly effective in fighting disease},

abstract={Alpha-toxin, the major cytotoxic agent elaborated by Staphylococcus aureus, was the first bacterial exotoxin to be identified as a pore former. The protein is secreted as a single-chain, water-soluble molecule of Mr 33,000. At low concentrations (less than 100 nM), the toxin binds to as yet unidentified, high-affinity acceptor sites that have been detected on a variety of cells including rabbit erythrocytes, human platelets, monocytes and endothelial cells. At high concentrations, the toxin additionally binds via nonspecific absorption to lipid bilayers; it can thus damage both cells lacking significant numbers of the acceptor and protein-free artificial lipid bilayers. Membrane damage occurs in both cases after membrane-bound toxin molecules collide via lateral diffusion to form ring-structured hexamers. The latter insert spontaneously into the lipid bilayer to form discrete transmembrane pores of effective diameter 1 to 2 nm. A hypothetical model is advanced in which the pore is lined by amphiphilic beta-sheets, one surface of which interacts with lipids whereas the other repels apolar membrane constitutents to force open an aqueous passage. The detrimental effects of alpha-toxin are due not only to the death of susceptible targets, but also to the presence of secondary cellular reactions that can be triggered via Ca2+ influx through the pores. Well-studied phenomena include the stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism, triggering of granule exocytosis, and contractile dysfunction. Such processes cause profound long-range disturbances such as development of pulmonary edema and promotion of blood coagulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

pages={177-190},
abstract={The interaction ofStaphylococcus aureus $\alpha$-toxin with planar lipid membranes results in the formation of ionic channels whose conductance can be directly measured in voltage-clamp experiments. Single-channel conductance depends linearly on the solution conductivity suggesting that the pores are filled with aqueous solution; a rough diameter of 11.4{\textpm}0.4 {\AA} can be estimated for the pore. The conductance depends asymmetrically on voltage and it is slightly anion selective at pH 7.0, which implies that the channels are asymmetrically oriented into the bilayer and that ion motion is restricted at least in a region of the pore. The pores are usually open in a KCl solution but undergo a dose- and voltage-dependent inactivation in the presence of diand trivalent cations, which is mediated by open-closed fluctuations at the single-channel level. Hill plots indicate that each channel can bind two to three inactivating cations. The inhibiting efficiency follows the sequence Zn2+>Tb3+>Ca2+>Mg2+>Ba2+. suggesting that carboxyl groups of the protein may be involved in the binding step. A voltage-gated inactivation mechanism is proposed which involves the binding of two polyvalent cations to the channel, one in the open and one in the closed configuration, and which can explain voltage, dose and time dependence of the inactivation.},

To explore the pore-forming mechanism of α-HL in detail, we determined the crystal structure of the α-HL monomer and prepore using H35A mutant and W179A/R200A mutant, respectively. Although the overall structure of the monomer was similar to that of other staphylococcal PFTs, a marked difference was observed in the N-terminal amino latch, which bent toward the prestem. Moreover, the prestem was fastened by the cap domain with a key hydrogen bond between Asp45 and Tyr118. Prepore structure showed that the transmembrane region is roughly formed with flexibility, although the upper half of the β-barrel is formed appropriately. Structure comparison among monomer, prepore and pore revealed a series of motions, in which the N-terminal amino latch released upon oligomerization destroys its own key hydrogen bond between Asp45–Tyr118. This action initiated the protrusion of the prestem. Y118F mutant and the N-terminal truncated mutant markedly decreased in the hemolytic activity, indicating the importance of the key hydrogen bond and the N-terminal amino latch on the pore formation. Based on these observations, we proposed a dynamic molecular mechanism of pore formation for α-HL.}

As a major branch of PFPs, bacteria pore-forming toxins (PFTs) permeabilize membranes and usually cause the death of target cells. E. coli hemolysin ClyA is the first member with the pore complex structure solved among α-PFTs, employing α-helices as transmembrane elements. ClyA is proposed to form pores composed of various numbers of protomers. With high-resolution cryo-EM structures, we observe that ClyA pore complexes can exist as newly confirmed oligomers of a tridecamer and a tetradecamer, at estimated resolutions of 3.2 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively. The 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure of a dodecamer dramatically improves the existing structural model. Structural analysis indicates that protomers from distinct oligomers resemble each other and neighboring protomers adopt a conserved interaction mode. We also show a stabilized intermediate state of ClyA during the transition process from soluble monomers to pore complexes. Unexpectedly, even without the formation of mature pore complexes, ClyA can permeabilize membranes and allow leakage of particles less than ~400 Daltons. In addition, we are the first to show that ClyA forms pore complexes in the presence of cholesterol within artificial liposomes. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the dynamic process of pore assembly for the prototypical α-PFT ClyA.},

abstract={Pore-forming toxins are protein assemblies used by many organisms to disrupt the membranes of target cells. They are expressed as soluble monomers that assemble spontaneously into multimeric pores. However, owing to their complexity, the assembly processes have not been resolved in detail for any pore-forming toxin. To determine the assembly mechanism for the ring-shaped, homododecameric pore of the bacterial cytolytic toxin ClyA, we collected a diverse set of kinetic data using single-molecule spectroscopy and complementary techniques on timescales from milliseconds to hours, and from picomolar to micromolar ClyA concentrations. The entire range of experimental results can be explained quantitatively by a surprisingly simple mechanism. First, addition of the detergent n-dodecyl-$\beta$-D-maltopyranoside to the soluble monomers triggers the formation of assembly-competent toxin subunits, accompanied by the transient formation of a molten-globule-like intermediate. Then, all sterically compatible oligomers contribute to assembly, which greatly enhances the efficiency of pore formation compared with simple monomer addition.},

Although the structure of crystalline ice had been solved only a few years earlier, and little was understood about the structures of liquids in general, in 1933 he published what is still regarded as a seminal paper which treated not only the structure of liquid water itself, but also addressed an impressively wide range of problems of ice and ionic solutions. Imaginatively exploiting ideas that were developing at the time, he proposed a model for water that reproduced the main features of its x-ray diffraction pattern. Despite the success of this model, however, he subsequently found it unsatisfactory – ‘‘a delusive approach, postulating a greater degree of order in the liquid than actually exists there’’. Building on the very successful ‘‘random packing’’ model of simple liquids that he developed in the 1950s and 60s, he was ultimately led to a ‘‘random network’’ model that was consistent with the known properties of the individual water molecules, and that again could reproduce a range of experimental data – but this time without the model being too ordered. Todays state of the art experiments essentially verify the underlying validity of his ideal model. And even his 1933 model of the water molecule itself is mimicked in some of the more successful molecular models used in todays computer simulations of aqueous systems.}

abstract = {In the X-ray scattering curve of chain-molecules in solution, essentially four regions may be distinguished as is shown by a more detailed mathematical discussion: (1) The scattering at the smallest angles, showing an approximately Gaussean course, whose ordinate, when extrapolated to zero angle, is proportional to the square of the mol. weight. It is due to the diffraction effect of the whole coiled chain-molecule. (2) This is followed by a region of v-values where the scattering falls off as 1/v2. It is due to parts of the chain molecule which themselves already occur in all possible orientations. (3) After a transition region (which is also accounted for by the theory) there follows a scattering which is proportional to 1/v. It is to be considered as the scattering of mostly straight parts of the molecule. (4) The scattering at large angles, caused by smaller parts of the molecule (monomer group and single atoms), which at the same time indicates the periodicity (= length of structural unit in the direction of the chain axis) by a step, at an angle corresponding to Bragg's law. Its sharpness, too, is a measure for the coiling of the molecule. It can be shown that the abscissa of the intersecting point of the 1/v2 and 1/v branches, when extrapolated to the transition region, is connected in a characteristic way with the statistical chain element or the “length of persistance”, which represent two different measures for the stiffness of the chain molecule. Measurements with polyvinyl bromide lead to a length of persistance of 11 ± 1 Å, which agrees satisfactorily with the value of 13 Å for polyvinyl chloride as derived from the birefringence of flow. At large angles two weak steps were found, one of which corresponds to the monomer length of 2.56 Å. Measurements on solutions of cellulose nitrate gave a curve ∼ 1/v without any steeper ascent up to the smallest angles, corresponding to 300 Å. We have, therefore, to conclude that the chain-element of cellulose nitrate is in any case larger than 150 Å, which again is in agreement with the results of other physical measurements. Though only a small number of experimental results is available so far, it seems to be established that the procedure yields a direct evaluation of the shape of chain molecules in solution and, in this respect, appears superior to other methods. However, the experimental difficulties are considerable.},

Biological nanopores generally perform better than artificial nanopores as sensors, but they have disadvantages including a fixed diameter. Here we introduce a biological nanopore ClyA that is wide enough to sample and distinguish large analyte proteins, which enter the pore lumen. Remarkably, human and bovine thrombins, despite 86 sequence identity, elicit characteristic ionic current blockades, which at -50 mV differ in their main current levels by 26 ± 1 pA. The use of DNA aptamers or hirudin as ligands further distinguished the protein analytes. Finally, we constructed ClyA nanopores decorated with covalently attached aptamers. These nanopores selectively captured and internalized cognate protein analytes but excluded noncognate analytes, in a process that resembles transport by nuclear pores.},

abstract = {Abstract The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Over the past several decades, specialized simulation methods have been developed to overcome this problem. We review one recently developed class of such methods, known as forward flux sampling. Forward flux sampling uses a series of interfaces between the initial and final states to calculate rate constants and generate transition paths for rare events in equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems with stochastic dynamics. This review draws together a number of recent advances, summarizes several applications of the method and highlights challenges that remain to be overcome.}

abstract = {Coarse-grained models have long been considered indispensable tools in the investigation of biomolecular dynamics and assembly. However, the process of simulating such models is arduous because unconventional force fields and particle attributes are often needed, and some systems are not in thermal equilibrium. Although modern molecular dynamics programs are highly adaptable, software designed for preparing all-atom simulations typically makes restrictive assumptions about the nature of the particles and the forces acting on them. Consequently, the use of coarse-grained models has remained challenging. Moltemplate is a file format for storing coarse-grained molecular models and the forces that act on them, as well as a program that converts moltemplate files into input files for LAMMPS, a popular molecular dynamics engine. Moltemplate has broad scope and an emphasis on generality. It accommodates new kinds of forces as they are developed for LAMMPS, making moltemplate a popular tool with thousands of users in computational chemistry, materials science, and structural biology. To demonstrate its wide functionality, we provide examples of using moltemplate to prepare simulations of fluids using many-body forces, coarse-grained organic semiconductors, and the motor-driven supercoiling and condensation of an entire bacterial chromosome.}

Providing such understanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology often depends critically on binding rates. Here, we explore DNA oligomer hybridization kinetics using a coarse-grained model. Strand association proceeds through a complex set of intermediate states, with successful binding events initiated by a few metastable base-pairing interactions, followed by zippering of the remaining bonds. But despite reasonably strong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently dissociate because typical configurations in which they form differ from typical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble. Initial contacts must be stabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely, resulting in negative effective activation enthalpies. Non-Arrhenius behavior arises because the number of base pairs required for nucleation increases with temperature. In addition, we observe two alternative pathways—pseudoknot and inchworm internal displacement—through which misaligned duplexes can rearrange to form duplexes. These pathways accelerate hybridization. Our results explain why experimentally observed association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of AT- rich equivalents, and more generally demonstrate how association rates can be modulated by sequence choice.}",

abstract={Dynamic DNA nanotechnology often uses toehold-mediated strand displacement for controlling reaction kinetics. Although the dependence of strand displacement kinetics on toehold length has been experimentally characterized and phenomenologically modeled, detailed biophysical understanding has remained elusive. Here, we study strand displacement at multiple levels of detail, using an intuitive model of a random walk on a 1D energy landscape, a secondary structure kinetics model with single base-pair steps and a coarse-grained molecular model that incorporates 3D geometric and steric effects. Further, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of three-way branch migration. Two factors explain the dependence of strand displacement kinetics on toehold length: (i) the physical process by which a single step of branch migration occurs is significantly slower than the fraying of a single base pair and (ii) initiating branch migration incurs a thermodynamic penalty, not captured by state-of-the-art nearest neighbor models of DNA, due to the additional overhang it engenders at the junction. Our findings are consistent with previously measured or inferred rates for hybridization, fraying and branch migration, and they provide a biophysical explanation of strand displacement kinetics. Our work paves the way for accurate modeling of strand displacement cascades, which would facilitate the simulation and construction of more complex molecular systems.},

abstract = {Abstract UCSF ChimeraX is the next-generation interactive visualization program from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics (RBVI), following UCSF Chimera. ChimeraX brings (a) significant performance and graphics enhancements; (b) new implementations of Chimera's most highly used tools, many with further improvements; (c) several entirely new analysis features; (d) support for new areas such as virtual reality, light-sheet microscopy, and medical imaging data; (e) major ease-of-use advances, including toolbars with icons to perform actions with a single click, basic “undo” capabilities, and more logical and consistent commands; and (f) an app store for researchers to contribute new tools. ChimeraX includes full user documentation and is free for noncommercial use, with downloads available for Windows, Linux, and macOS from https://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimerax.},

journal={Nature},
year={2009},
month={Jun},
volume={459},
number={7247},
pages={726-730},
abstract={Some toxins exert cytotoxicity by assembling into multimeric pores in the membranes of their host cells. The bacterial $\alpha$-helical toxin cytolysin A, responsible for the haemolytic phenotype of several Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica strains, is one such pore-forming toxin, whose soluble structure is known. Here Mueller et al. describe the structure of its assembled dodecameric pore. The authors propose a sequential mechanism for the large rearrangements that the monomers undergo to form the $\alpha$-helical pore.},
