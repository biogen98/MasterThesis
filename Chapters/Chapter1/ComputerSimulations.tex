\section{Computer Simulations}

The theory of classical mechanics is often regarded as the first major breakthrough in
the field of physics. For every aspiring physicist this is still the starting point of
their studies. Unfortunately getting to know these relatively simple laws of nature,
leads to the inescapable realisation that these theories are expressed in mathematical
formalism that are only analytically solvable in few idealised scenarios. Applying these
formulas to a problem consisting of just more then two particles already leads
practically unsolvable equations.\\

Although it is often times not possible to find an exact solution to equations
related to complex physical systems, finding reasonable approximations to their solution
is. One popular method to analyse the dynamics of complex systems is the use of
simulations.\\

Simulations have a rich history within physics and engineering, starting even before the
invention of the computer. An example of one of these mechanical simulations is the
 Waterloopkundig Laboratorium or currently the waterloopbos, a scale model of important
Dutch waterways where the influence of waves on harbours and docks was studied. This
simulation provided revolutionary insights into the behaviour of water, this knowledge
played an important part in the design of the famous Delta Works.\\
Another example more topical example is the use of mechanical simulations to study the
structure of water.  In the early 20th century physicist J.D. Bernal and his fellow
researches build various ball and stick models of water to analyse the possible 3D
configurations of water molecules in a liquid. Their research eventually explained the
peculiar physical properties of water from a atomistic perspective. However useful these
mechanical simulations turned out to be, the biggest drawback of the method was the
extreme cost of labour corresponding to their construct. Bernal in his 1962 lecture,

\begin{quote}
\dots I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a
selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inch. I tried to do this in the
first place as casually as possible, working in my own office being interrupted every
five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.
However,\dots

After the first computer simulations where performed in the Los Alamos labs, the
popularity of simulations rapidly increased. The remarkable explanatory power of
simulations combined with the relative easy construction of computer models lead to a
fast adoption of computer simulations in the scientific community. Within the context of
this thesis, computer simulations are used to study the mechanics of
the DNA Polymer. Due to the high number of atoms in a typical system, it is generally
not possible to find an analytical solution to their equations of motion. In this
context, simulations are often used to gain an insight into the complex dynamics of the
system and guide the developments of more simple approximate theories. The simulations
act as a bridge between the microscopic constituents of the systems and the macroscopic
properties we want to understand.


\subsection{Molecular Dynamics Simulations}
Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation technique, used to analyse
the dynamics of a classical many-body system. The central idea of this method is to
generate all the particle trajectories in a system of $N$ particles by numerically
integrating the classical equations of motion,
\[
m_i \frac{d^2 \boldsymbol{r_i}}{dt^2} = \boldsymbol{f_i}, \quad \boldsymbol{f_i} = -
    \frac{\partial}{\partial \boldsymbol{r_i}} \mathcal{U}_i, \quad for\ i \in N.
\]
The motion of the particles are governed by the forces $f_i$ acting upon them, which are
usually derived from the interaction potentials $U_i$.
Solving these differential equations is achieved by employing a discretized time
integration scheme.  Algorithm 1 shows the typical structure of a molecular dynamics
simulations. The discretization resolution is conventionally called the time step of the
simulations denoted by $\Delta t$.\\

\noindent There are a large number of different integrations schemes that one can choose
from, this
choice depends interely on the system at hand.
When working with an isolated system -- i.e. microcanonical ensemble --, where the total
energy is conserved, logically a energy conserving integrater is needed. The canonical
choice for this type of integration scheme is the Velocity-Verlet algorithm. This
algorithm is an example of leapfrog integration, where the updating of the positions
and velocities are interlieved at different points in time. The major strenght of this
type of algorithm is that it turns out to be a symplectic integrator, which means the
errors on the concerved energy are bounded.

On the otherhand, when a system is in contact with a heatbath --i.e. canonical
ensemble--, not the total energy is concerved but rather the temperature of the
simulation needs to be fixed. To achieve this, a thermostat is implemented in the MD
simulation. A typical thermostat attempts to negate any drift in temperature by
appropriately importing or exporting energy to the system after each timestep.
Poplular examples of thermostats are the Nos\'e-Hoover thermostat or the Langevin
thermostat.  The latter regulates the temperature by introducing a implicit solvent to
the simulation that gives rise to random thermal kicks. The resulting equations of motion
are the langevin equations given by,

\begin{equation}
    m_i \frac{d^2 \boldsymbol{r}_i}{dt^2} = - \nabla \mathcal{U}_i - \gamma_i \frac{d
    \boldsymbol{r}_i}{d t} +
    \xi_i(t),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i$ is known  as the friction coefficient and $\xi_i(t)$ a random force
acting upon the particles. The combination of the last two terms fully capture the
statistical consequences of the solvent interacting with the system.

\subsection{Coarse Grained modelling}
As most thing do, molecular dynamics simulations have their pitfalls. When simulating
biophysical systems, a common problem is that the computations quickly become expensive
when there a lot of particles in the system.
During these simulations the most costly calculations are determining all the non-bonded
interaction in the system. These interatomic interactions make the computational
complexity for rudimentary MD simulations scale as $O(N^2t)$, here $N$ is the number of
particles in the system and t the simulation time. This bad scaling behaviour comes from
the fact that for each particle all the particles are contributing to its interaction
potential. To improve this scaling behaviour, the non-bonded interaction in a MD
simulation are almost always truncated. This has the nice effect that not all atoms are
contributing to each interaction potential. Efficient algorithm, like the multigrid
mehod, have been devided to perform these calculations with a scaling complexity of
$O(Nt)$.\\

Coarse graining is a method to further optimize molecular dynamics simulations.
Incontrary to all atom simulation, where each atom is explicitly  represented in the
simulation, Coarse grained simulations reduce the computational cost by rather working
with pseudo atoms.

Two distinctly different ways to construct a coarsed grained model. A first method is
tarting from the all atom model and generalysin nearby atoms into a larger pseudo atom,
this is called the bottom up aproach. When we are more interested in the thermodynamical
properties rather than the precise small scale dynamics, constructing larger pseudo atoms
and tweaking their interactionsa allows for more low resolution models. This method is
calle the bottom up approach.

For DNA simulation all atom simulations, tens of bases over a micor second time scale.
Coarse graingin allows for much longer strands to be  simulations over longer time,
studying large scale phenomena like super coiling.
