\section{Biological Nanopores}

Biological nanopores are small perforations in a lipid bilayer membrane, created
by a pore forming protein.  The majority of these proteins are toxins produced by
pathogenic bacteria. Their function in nature is to perforate the membrane of a cell,
causing the cell to depolarize, disrupting vital cell functions. The perforation also
induces an osmotic potential, causing cell nutrients to spill into the environment. Both
effects eventually result in the killing of the cell.

The reason scientists are interested in studying nanopores is related to their size.
These protein structures are generally only a few nanometres in diameter, making them
comparable in size to the tiny transistors found in modern computers. Retrieving
information form nano-scale processes has proven to be a challenging task. Developing
sensors to probe this small length scale is thereby very relevant. This is the exact task
nanopores provide a possible solution to, i.e. spectroscopy at the smallest
scale.

Before delving into ionic current spectroscopy, the primary application of nanopores, a
brief overview will be given of the structural properties of two popular biological
nanopores.

\subsection{$\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL)}

The $\alpha$-Hemolysin ($\alpha$-HL) protein is the most commonly used pore forming
protein to create nanopores. It is produced by the Staphylococcus aureus, a
bacterium commonly found in the human skin microbiome[.].

The $\alpha$-HL pore (PDBID:7AHL[.]) is an oligomeric complex with multiple naturally
occurring variations. The most typical configuration
is a heptameric structure, meaning that there are seven protomers found in the complex.
The secondary structure elements consist principally of $\beta$-sheets, making them a
member of the $\beta$-barrel pore-forming toxins. Through both electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions, the $\alpha$-HL is bound to the membrane of a target cell. Here
the monomers assemble to a 'prepore' complex that transitions to the stable pore complex
by inserting the $\beta$-barrel into the membrane.[.]

Structurally the shape of $\alpha$-HL resembles that of a hollow mushroom, see fig ....
The total hight of the complex is 11nm and the maximum width is measured to be 10nm. The
internal chamber of the pore located at the cis-side of the membrane is called the lumen.
The lumen of $\alpha$-HL is quite constricted having a diameter of merely $3\nm$.  At the
membrane the lumen chamber transitions into a protein stem, referred to as the
constriction of the pore. Here the diameter of the chamber is reduced to a minimum of
1.5nm. On the wall of $\alpha$-HL's inside chambers, the charges are relatively uniformly
distributed. This will play an important role in further applications[.].

\subsection{Cytolysin A (ClyA)}
% Zie Bayoumi and Kherim for references.

The Cytolysin A (ClyA) is a larger type of pore forming protein first found to be
secreted by E. coli strains[.]. The larger size of its lumen allows for different types
of applications compared to smaller complexes like $\alpha$-HL. The larger diameter of
the pore's stem allows for translocation of double stranded DNA, which is most relevant
for this thesis.

The ClyA pore (PDBID:6MRT[.]) is an oligomeric complex most typically found in a
 dodecameric configuration, meaning that there are twelve protomers found in the
complex. In nature small variations on this configuration are found. The secondary
structure elements consist principally of $\alpha$-helices, making it a member of the $
\alpha$-pore-forming toxins. The protein formation is induced by the hydrophobic
interactions between the monomers $\beta$-hairpin and the solvent. The main
structural rearrangement in this process consists of swinging out this $\beta$-tongue and
inserting it into the membrane. After this transition, the membrane-bounded monomers
oligomerize to from the final pore structure.

Structurally the shape of ClyA resembles that of two hollow cylinders stacked on top of
each other. This cylinder approximation will be important later on in this thesis, where
it will be used to create a simplified model of the nanopore. The total hight of the
complex is 14nm and the maximum width is measured to be 11nm. The lumen's size of this
nanopore differentiates it from the previously discussed $\alpha$-HL. The cis-entrance of
the lumen measures 6nm, while the constricted side of the pore is still 3.6nm in
diameter.  In contrary to the $\alpha$-HL, the inside surface of ClyA has a net negative
charge, making it cation sensitive. This excess charge will induce an significant coulomb
interaction between the pore and negatively charged analytes[.].

\subsection{Ionic current spectroscopy}
In recent years the study of nanopores became a popular research domain, mainly
due to the development of the nanopore-based ionic current spectroscopy. For the case of
biological nanopores, this method is depicted in figure \ref{fig:IonicCurrentSpec}. A
lipid bilayer is perforated using a pore forming protein, for example $\alpha$-HL. The
membrane separates two compartments filled with a saline solution. When a potential
difference is created over the membrane, the nanopore mediates an ion current between the
two liquid-filled compartments.

This ion current through the pore can accurately be measured. If the pore is empty we
refer to the measured current as the open-pore current. However, the applied electric
field also induces forces upon analytes dissolved in the liquid. The net result of these
interactions is a flux of analytes towards and in some cases through the nanopore.
Analytes located inside of the nanopore partially block the ion current through the pore,
reducing the measured current. Using machine learning algorithms the time series of
these current fluctuation can be measured and identified with particular analytes in the
solution. These methods are so precise that they allow for single cell spectroscopy.

It should be noted that besides these biological nanopores there are also inorganic
nanopores in development[.]. An example are solid state nanopores created by making
perforations in a semi-conductor wafer. While currently not as accessible as biological
nanopres, mainly due to their high production costs, this method has some major
advantages.  First of all the material properties provide a chemical robustness not
present in biological nanopores. The production process also allows for easy scalability
and customisability. While currently not as widely used as biological nanopores, solid
state nanopores will prove to be an important asset in the future of nanotechnology.
