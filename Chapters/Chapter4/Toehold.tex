\section{Hybridisation Reactions}

3 alineas! + photo

Understand entropy, now study hybridisation.
First simulation of free DNA toehold displacement. proof of of concepts
Simulation performed of ds-rotaxane to ss-rotaxane.

simulation halted at ..
hybridisation needs to happen inside of the pore (exclude possibility of fast dynamics)
-> no place for three strands.

compliant constrictoin of the pore entrance -> alpha helices, gebruik reference.
