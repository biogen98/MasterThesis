\chapter*{Abstract}

Autonomous molecular machines are ubiquitous in the machinery of life, collectively
driving the molecular processes in our cells. Inspired by these biological machines,
scientists
develop synthetic devices performing specialised operations at the nanoscale. In this
thesis we study a specific molecular machine designed by Bayoumi et al.\cite{Bayoumi21},
which is composed of a DNA-neutravidin piston trapped inside a ClyA nanopore.

Using the free energy of DNA hybridisation this molecular machine is able to perform
autonomous and active transport of DNA cargo both following or opposing an
external bias force. During each operating cycle of the nanopiston a DNA cargo
is transported from the cis- to the trans-side of the membrane, in which the piston is
embedded.

Due to the length scale associated with molecular machines performing in depth
experimental studies has been proven to be challenging. During this thesis we aim
to shed light on the operating principles of the nanopiston by using molecular dynamics
simulations. Motivated by the computational cost of classical all-atom simulations a
coarse-grained model of the DNA nanopiston is designed.

Entropic interactions between the DNA piston and the nanopore are thought to
play an important role in facilitating the DNA transport. Studying these effects reveal
two distinct origins of entropic forces. Large double stranded DNA is kept predominantly
outside of the pore's constriction, by the entropic penalty of confinement.  Whereas, the
flexible single stranded DNA also
endouvours to maximize its available configurational space by opposing confinement.

Consecutively the  conformational fluctuations of
the nanopiston are studied.  These simulations clearly show the importance of the
entropic interactions promoting the operation cycle.  The entropic
penalty of confining the flexible single stranded DNA components of the piston in the
nanopore enable the continuation of the hybridisation reactions.

In an attempt to study a full piston cycle, the hybridisation reactions driving the
operation are simulated using our coarse-grained
model. Due to the inherent difficulty of simulating these reactions an advanced
sampling method called forward flux sampling is needed.
While performing these simulations the main limitation of our coarse-grained model is
encountered. The compliance of the biological nanopore is found to be essential in
facilitating the hybridisation pathways, but is not yet incorporated in our current
model.
